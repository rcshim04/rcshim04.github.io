            <p>Hi, my name is Eric Shim.</p>
            <p>I am a student currently enrolled in the MaCS (Math and Computer Science) program at William Lyon Mackenzie Collegiate Institute.</p>
            <p>
                My hobbies include programming, reading, writing and listening to music, dancing, and playing games.
                I also enjoy a variety of sports such as running, biking, swimming, skiing, and skating.
                While I love my sports, I still enjoy programming more than anything.
                This website holds tutorials that I've written about the material taught in the ICS4UO course.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am involved in a variety of extracurricular activities, both in and out of school.
                I play in a youth orchestra as a violist outside school, and as a french horn player in my school's wind ensemble.
                I was in HOSA for dental science, and I actively participate in the science club's activites.
                I am an avid programmer on both the school's competitive programming site, as well as during school programming competitions.
                I was a part of the ski team at school this year, and I do taekwondo on the side when I find time.
                Aside from this, I am also part of the school tech team, and I am the tech representative for both student council and arts council.
                I work as an assistant lifeguard, and my volunteer experience ranges from working at city festivals to an assistant teacher at summer school.
            </p>
